# game_sentiment_analysis
This Python script uses text-to-vector encoders and Logistic Regression to classify customers evaluation between good or bad.

The "sentiment_analysis.ipynb" notebook contains the code to encode the texts and the classifier training procedure.

The file "teste.csv" is a small hand-collected dataset, using Amazon's evaluations about the game Cyberpunk 2077. The class 0 defines a bad evaluation and the class 1 defines a good evaluation.
